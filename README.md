# GoogleFormVote    
This project was to help my friend's band to win a contest where the most voted band in a google form would perform at a local festival.

The person who created this Google form made my life easier and didn't add a captcha or any mechanism to prevent web scraping.
Also, I had to remove my friend's band name for privacy reasons.
